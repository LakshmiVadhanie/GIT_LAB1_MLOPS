Changes Made:

1. Advanced Calculator Functions 
- Added 4 new functions to calculator.py:
  - fun5(x, y) - Division with zero error checking
  - fun6(x, y) - Power operation (x^y)
  - fun7(x) - Square root
  - fun8(x, y) - Modulo (remainder)

2. Integration Tests 
- Created test_integration.py with 5 workflow tests:
  - Workflow 1: Add → Subtract → Multiply
  - Workflow 2: Division → Add → Power
  - Workflow 3: Complex math operations
  - Workflow 4: Modulo + Square root combined
  - Error handling tests (division by zero, negative square root, etc.)
